# hap-proxy

`hap-proxy` is currently work in progress and definitely not finished,
The end goal is to have an hap proxy, which can be used to reverse engineer some hap accessories.
Currently only the client is implemented.

## Notes

This project is heavily inspired by the code base of [HAP-NodeJS](https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS)
(most of the encryption and decryption layers) and [hap-client](https://github.com/forty2/hap-client).
